Noise applied to different levels of M.

## Introduction
This is the implementation of Reed-Muller coding and decoding using Python.

This project uses Python and Streamlit to demonstrate the Reed-Muller coding and decoding process. With this implementation, you can:

- Encode and decode individual vectors, text, and images.
- Apply different types of noise to the encoded data.
- Visualize the effects of noise and the decoding process.
